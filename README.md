# Music_Player 
I have built a Music Player using html , css , javascript.
You can also toggle from light mode to dark mode by tapping the moon icon.
You can play , pause the music.
You can also play the next song , and also the previous song.
You can also tap on shuffle button to play any random song.
You can also play the same song on loop by tapping on loop button.
You can also see the length of song.
